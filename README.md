QuadSim is an application developed for the Kinect, which me and my partners developed at Rutgersâ€™s Hackathon in 24 hours We won Microsoft API from approximately 750 students that came from all over North America. This App was designed to for enjoyment for young children. Also for people with arthritics and to help them get movement back in the upper body. It would cost them less than what they would pay at the hospital. This was developed in C# using Visual Studio, but we also had to use 3D modeling with AutoCAD, Animation with Blender.
